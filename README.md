# CSCI561-Foundations-of-AI
This repo contains homeworks and assignments completed as part of CSCI-561 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at USC in Spring 2023.

### Homework 1
Homework 1 was about search algorithms and path planning. 3 search algorithms were implemented as part of this homewrok - 
1. Breadth-first search (BFS)
2. Unifrom-cost search (UCS)
3. A* search

This was implemented in Java and passed 43/50 test cases.

The full problem statement can be found [here](./Homework%201%20-%20Search%20Algorithms/hw1-csci561-sp23.pdf).

### Homework 2
Homework 2 was about designing a game playing agent using aplha-beta pruning. The game for this semester was Pente, which is similar o and is played on a board of size 19x19.   
This was implemented in CPP and tested via 20 games. 10 games were played againt a random agent, and 10 games against a simple mini-max agent. 
This code won 20/20 games.

### Homework 3
In homework 3, we implemented firs-order logic resolution. The program was to take multiple sentences in a KB as input, and the objective was to conclude if a query asked was entailed from the KB or not. 

This was implemented in Python, and passed 47/50 testcases.
